## How It Works
The script analyzes historical price data to detect specific candlestick patterns and highlights them on the chart. When a pattern is detected, it provides a color-coded background and/or a label indicating a potential buy or sell signal.

## Installation
1. **Open TradingView**: Go to [TradingView](https://www.tradingview.com/).
2. **Open Pine Editor**: At the bottom of the TradingView page, click on the "Pine Editor" tab.
3. **Copy and Paste the Script**: Copy the Pine Script code from this repository and paste it into the Pine Editor.
4. **Save the Script**: Click on the "Save" button, give the script a name, and save it.
5. **Add to Chart**: Click on the "Add to Chart" button to apply the indicator to your chart.

## Usage
1. Once the script is added to your chart, it will automatically start analyzing the candlestick patterns.
2. Buy signals will be indicated by green labels and backgrounds, while sell signals will be indicated by red labels and backgrounds.
3. Adjust the chart's time frame and zoom level to see how the indicator performs with different data sets.
